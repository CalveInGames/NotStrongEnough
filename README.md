# NotStrongEnough

"Not Strong Enough" is a short, Psychological, 2.5D, puzzle-based narrative PC game that uses environmental and visual storytelling. The game takes a branch and bottleneck narrative structure and it follows "Anyone," the primary character, as they deal with their mental health on a daily basis.
In a lonely apartment devoid of hope, “Anyone” finds themselves struggling to live with day-to-day life. Daily chores necessitate a tremendous amount of strength and maintaining any semblance of a routine is impossible. Instead, retreating to the safe haven of a warm and cosy bed is sometimes the only way "Anyone" gets through the day. 
Ignoring the 5 steps to overcome depression blu-tacked on their fridge, “Anyone” experiences the days all blend into one as they do household essentials. "Anyone" slowly begins to find positivity in day-to-day life as chore after chore is completed, until calamity hits and the guilt of it all becomes too much to bear.

Themes:
Depression, Dread, Guilt, Mental Health & Suicide. 

Mechanics: 
“W,A,S,D” or the directional keys (←, ↑, →, ↓) to move and explore. 
Space Bar to cycle through dialogue.
“E” to interact with surrounding objects in the 2.5D world. 
Right Mouse Click/Hold to interact and move/drag objects on screen in the 2D puzzles. 
Tap ↑ or ↓ to get in and out of bed.

Visual Feel: 
An umber aesthetic tone is used throughout the game and its setting to evoke feelings of desolation. The game's colour design is dark and earthy, with very little use of bright colours. The primary character, "Anyone," has a sketched art style with no recognisable features. This is to demonstrate that mental health issues can and do affect "Anyone."

Environment: 
The game takes place in an untidy studio apartment. The apartment is rendered in 2.5D and is divided into three sections throughout the game.
Kitchen, Bedroom, and Bathroom.
The camera remains stationary in each area of the apartment, fixed on a single room.
The camera uses zoom-ins to depict how the walls around "Anyone" are closing in.
W,A,S, and D, or The Directional Keys, are used to navigate the apartment.
By pressing "E" on objects in the apartment, you can interact with them and learn more about the plot. (For example, a couple of letters stashed away in a drawer)
The majority of the audio in this game is made up of quiet, melancholic piano music. 
























NOT STRONG ENOUGH
Game Script 

Day 1: 

::The camera travels through an unkempt studio apartment as the scene fades in. The furniture is lifeless, and the walls have turned a bleak umber hue. Filthy clothing is stacked high in the bedroom, while food-stained dishes are piled in the kitchen.::

The camera zooms in on a list that is blu-tacked to the fridge. It reads;

Things to help with depression: 
Talk to someone you love.
Go for a walk.
Eat healthier. 
Have a routine.
Do one thing at a time.
Seek professional help. 

::The first sound the player hears is the buzzing of a mobile phone. The camera focuses on the phone, and two text messages emerge on the screen.::
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Hey.” 

“How are you, bro?” 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::With the mouse the messages are able to be swiped away by the player, and when they are, the camera pans out to see "Anyone" putting the phone back down on the bedside drawer. After this brief scene, the camera pans out to reveal "Anyone", who has no discernible features and appears to be a blank character canvas, lying in bed with the objective "Get Out Of Bed" written in the top left corner of the screen. The aim is accompanied by directions to "Tap ↑ key," which hover above "Anyone". When the player does this, numerous separate Dialogue Bubbles display over the character's head.::

After the ↑ key is pressed 2 times = "I should really get out of bed." 

After 5 times = "I really can't be bothered."

After 8 times = "The clothes are really starting to pile up." 

After 10 times = "Ugh, what's even the point."

::When the action has been exhausted, the character slumps back down.::  

Dialogue Bubble: “I'm not in the right frame of mind today. Perhaps tomorrow.”   
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::With a ticking clock sound effect, the scene fades to black over several seconds.:: 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Day 2:

::"Anyone" is sleeping as the scene fades in. "Get Out Of Bed" is the same aim that shows on the screen as before. The player is once again instructed to "Tap the ↑ key" repeatedly. After a few taps "Anyone" gets out of bed as a result, and the environment is filled with melancholy background music. The player can now use the Directional keys or the W, A, S, and D keys to walk around and explore the apartment. At this moment, the "Get Out Of Bed" objective is replaced by three new ones.:: 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Brush Teeth.” 
“Do The Laundry.” 
“Wash Up The Dishes.”
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side Story:
IF the player decides to interact with the laundry:

Dialogue Bubble: “I’m not mentally strong enough today.” 

Accompanied by an “X” through the middle of that objective. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side Story:
IF the player decides to interact with the washing up: 

Dialogue Bubble: “I’m not mentally strong enough today.” 

Accompanied by an “X” through the middle of that objective. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Story:
IF the player decides to enter the bathroom area, the camera zooms in on the mirror above the sink. In the mirror, a reflection of "Anyone" is displayed feigning and forcing a grin. 

Dialogue Bubbles: "Wow, my teeth are a disgraceful shade of yellow." "I suppose I should brush them."
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: After the player has exhausted the Dialogue Bubbles a toothbrush glows underneath the mirror and upon being clicked the scene transitions into a 2D puzzle of an open mouth with a draggable toothbrush. The screen whitens as the player swipes the toothbrush from left to right across the exposed teeth. The scene turns back to "Anyone" standing in front of the bathroom mirror after the player fills the screen with whiteness.::

Dialogue Bubble: “That didn’t really do much, did it?” 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
::The "Brush Teeth" objective is ticked off and then disappears after the player closes the Dialogue Bubble. The player can hear their mobile buzzing after the objective has vanished, and when they return to the nightstand in the bedroom, they can interact with the phone and find that it is their father contacting them. The player has three seconds to interact with the call while it is shown on the screen. They won't be able to answer this call, but if they're quick enough, they'll be able to decline it.::
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF When the countdown expires without the player acting, they return the phone to the bedside table. 

Dialogue Bubble: “Eh, if it’s important he’ll call back.”

::The phone vibrates once again, and a text message is received.::

“Hello, kiddo! I'm considering dropping by towards the end of the week; it'll be great to see you. Love you and stay safe. Dad.”  
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
IF the player chooses to decline the call, a voicemail is left. The player can hear the voiceover, which is complemented by a textbox.

“Hey it’s just your old man checking in to see how you're doing because your mother and I haven't heard from you in a long time. I know you've got your own problems, but your brother hasn't been feeling well lately, and I'm sure he'd love to hear from you, as would we all. Keep yourself safe, kiddo. Love you.” 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::With their phone in their hand, "Anyone" sits on the side of the bed. The melancholic music slows down, and the player watches the minutes and hours tick away on the phone's clock until it reaches 9 p.m.::


Dialogue Bubble: “I don't have the strength today.”
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
::After a few seconds, the scene fades to black.:: 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 3: 

::"Anyone" sits on the side of their bed with their head in their hands as the scene fades in. In the top left corner, there are two objectives.::
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Get Out Of Bed. 
Do The Laundry. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
::After exhausting the ↑ Key to get out of bed, “Objective 1” disappears and the player can freely move around the apartment.:: 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
IF the player interacts with the pile of filthy laundry the scene changes to a 2D backdrop of a washing basket with a drag and drop puzzle. The aim of the puzzle is to use the mouse to drag the clothing into the basket. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
::When the puzzle is finished, the scene returns to the apartment. "Anyone" will thereafter be shown walking about the flat with a full washing basket..:: 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
IF the player approaches the washing machine and interacts with it, the scene changes to a 2D backdrop of an open washing machine. The player must drag garments from the basket into the washing machine using the mouse.
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
::The scene resumes to the apartment as soon as the player completes this puzzle, and the "Do The Laundry" objective is fulfilled. A new objective appears: "Call Dad."::
 
::“Anyone” can be seen getting back into bed after interacting with the phone. "Anyone" is then shown on their phone, with the camera mostly focusing on the phone screen. The player can interact with the phone and even use a few apps using left mouse clicks.::
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Side Story:
The Shopping App - When clicked the player can navigate up and down a page of things on a shopping website, adding items to their cart and finalising their purchase. 

IF the player opens the banking app BEFORE the shopping app, when trying to checkout an alert will be shown to say "insufficient funds." 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Side Story:
The Banking App - When clicked an online bank statement appears, indicating a £7.32 available balance in the account.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Side Story: 
The Maze Game App - A simple maze will appear on the phone, and the player will navigate it with the W, A, S, and D keys. After the player completes the level, the software malfunctions and shows an "Error" warning before returning the player to the phone's home screen.

"There's no need to bother them right now."
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
IF the player tries to call "Helpline" an automated voice message will be played. 

"You've reached the National Health Service's Mental Health Helpline. We're sorry, but we're temporarily closed, with new patients facing wait times of up to 18 weeks. Please phone 999 if you require immediate assistance." 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
IF the player calls “Dad”, the call will go to voicemail.

"Hello, I'm presently unavailable; please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible." 

The player has the choice of three options. 

"Hey Dad, everything is okay. I managed to put a wash on today. Talk soon, love you. 
Hey Dad. Clearly I caught you while you're busy. Talk later. 
Do not leave a voicemail and hang up. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
After the choice the objective "Call Dad" gets ticked off and replaced with "Go To Sleep" 

A prompt to press the ↓ key above "Anyone" appears and only requires the player to press it once to curl up and fall asleep. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
::The camera zooms out and the scene fades to black.:: 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 





Day 4:

::The scene fades in, it's brighter than normal, and birds chirping can be heard in the background with some light-hearted peaceful piano music::

Dialogue Bubble: “I’ll reply to those later.” 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
::The objective "Wash Up The Dishes" appears in the top left corner of the screen.::

Dialogue Bubble: "If I start with one, maybe doing more won't be that bad." 

::When the player interacts with the dishes, a 2D visual of a sink and a pile of dirty dishes is displayed. The goal is to drag the sponge over each dish one at a time until all of the dirt is removed. When the player cleans a dish, it goes into the drying rack next to the sink. Throughout the puzzle, a discordant generic pop beat can be heard.::

After 6 dishes have been cleaned, a cutscene shows "Anyone" dancing in front of the sink as the player objective gets ticked off. 

Dialogue Bubble: "That genuinely wasn't so bad and took no time at all." 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
When the camera pans to the kitchen clock, it's clear that it's broken. In the top left corner, a new objective, "Fix The Clock," appears.

Dialogue Bubble: "I know there are some batteries around here… somewhere." 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
IF the player looks in the BATHROOM they will be able to interact with the medicine cabinet. Inside will be a bottle of fluoxetine (antidepressants).

Dialogue Bubble: "How long has it been since I've taken these?" 

The player will then be met with a choice. 

Take an antidepressant
Put the bottle away. 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Congratulations, you've passed your driving test" 


"We're writing to inform you that you've been disqualified after a police investigation found you driving while being heavily medicated."
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
IF the player looks in the KITCHEN area they can interact with the dining room table. A "Junk Box" sits atop the table. The player will discover the batteries inside.

::The player will be greeted with a 2D scene when they return and interact with the broken clock. The goal is to use the mouse to click and drag the old batteries out, then drag and drop the new ones in.::
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The scene transitions back to the apartment and the clock can be heard ticking.

Dialogue bubble: "Gee, I hope it's not 3 a.m., my phone should know the correct time."
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
::Upon interacting with the phone, the player can see 14 missed calls from "Mum" and a text message.::

"It's important, call me back immediately." 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
::A "Call Mum" button takes up a large chunk of the UI. When clicked, the phone will ring for several seconds before a voice over is heard.:: 

"Hey sweetie, we've had some terrible news, you should probably be sitting down for this." 

The player is tasked to press the  ↓ key to sit down on the bed. Once pressed the conversation continues. 

"This morning, your brother's health took a turn for the worse, and he was rushed to the hospital. The doctors tried everything they could, but..." 

::Faint cries from “Mum” can be heard as “Dad” takes over the conversation.:: 

"Sorry, kiddo, but your mother is in a tough situation. She's taken aback. This isn't the news that any of us had hoped for. We're all going through a really trying period right now. We knew he was sick, but we had no idea how serious it was. If you need to, you're welcome to remain with us for a while. That is something I believe both your mother and I would appreciate. I'll be there tomorrow, champ; keep strong.” 
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The phone call ends and a cutscene of "Anyone" getting into bed is shown. They pull up the last text messages from their brother that they received. 

"Hey." 

"How are you, bro?"

Over slow and melancholy piano music, muffled cries can be heard. The scene begins to fade to black, but then abruptly returns. The last cutscene is shot in stop motion.
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
IF The player DID choose to take an antidepressant earlier in the day. The character will be shown heading into the bathroom, they reach into the cabinet for the bottle of antidepressants and empty the entire bottle into their mouth. The scene slowly fades to black.

IF the player DID NOT take an antidepressant earlier in the game, the camera pans to the kitchen. ”Anyone” approaches the dining room table where the junk box is kept. They take a piece of rope and knot it into a noose. As the image fades to black, they are seen pulling one of the dining chairs into the bedroom.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
::THE END::
